<p>It is important to understand how Cozy is built to understand how it works. Let&#39;s quickly see how it looks like.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/cozy-architecture.png" alt="Architecture Overview"></p>
<p>Too long, don&#39;t want to read ? Check out what you should remember! (<em>link to bottom of page</em>)</p>
<p>Cozy is made of three different layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Proxy</li>
<li>the pPaaS</li>
<li>the persistence layer</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Proxy (<a href="https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-proxy/">Github repository</a>)</h2>
<p>The proxy main job is handling the authentification and authorization to the Cozy. This is the application that manage registration, login, logout and password reset.</p>
<p>It also handles all the routing of Cozy (to send a request to the right application).</p>
<h2>The pPaaS (<a href="https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-controller/">Github repository</a>)</h2>
<p>pPaaS stands for &quot;personal Platform as a Service&quot;.
You may already now what a PaaS is: an execution environment for applications.
A personal PaaS is a personal execution environment for personal applications collaboring around personal data. You got it, a pPaaS is all about the user!</p>
<p>Technically, the &quot;controller&quot; and the &quot;home application&quot; play with each other to install, run, update and remove applications within Cozy. We&#39;ve forked <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/haibu">Haibu</a> to add custom options: more security (applications are run by separate users, restrict the access to the controller itself, ...), handling apps authentification to the Data System, logging, ...</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-controller/">cozy-controller</a> can also be used through a dedicated tool, the <a href="https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-monitor/">cozy-monitor</a>. You shouldn&#39;t worried too much about it since it is unlikely you will use it one day (except if you host your own Cozy or are willing to contribute to the core).</p>
<h2>The persistence layer: the Data System (<a href="https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-data-system/">Github Repository</a>)</h2>
<p>You&#39;ve just built your first app using SQLite and you are wondering why we speak about another persistence mecanism? Well, let us introduce you the Data System.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a unified API that allows applications to access:</p>
<ul>
<li>the database (CouchDB)</li>
<li>the file system</li>
<li>the indexer (Woosh)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Data System is where Cozy&#39;s power is. It allows the user to chose which application accesses which type of data so he can <strong>control</strong> and <strong>decide</strong> wether he trusts or not an application.
It also opens the opportunity to use multiple data-source. Do you want to have contacts in your agenda application? Do it!</p>
<p>A dedicated section will describe the Data System, its API and how to use it in details.</p>
<h2>What you should remember</h2>
<p>As a developer, you are going to create an application that will be run by Cozy&#39;s pPaaS. That application will access the data through the Data System.
Also, you won&#39;t have to bother about user authentification and authorization because it is all handled by the Proxy.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you develop for a <strong>personal</strong> environment which is not something we are used to at first but it only changes the relation to data we had until now!</p>
